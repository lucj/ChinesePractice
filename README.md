# Purpose

Chinese practice is a python script that helps you to practise your chinese using some vocabulary list.

# Usage

Once you have cloned the repository, run python script directly with:

    python practise.py

If you prefer running it though Docker (like I do :) ), just run

docker run -ti lucj/chinese-practice:1.0

# TODO

- [ ] take into account english version (4th col in vocabulary list)
- [ ] add label for HSK1/2/3/... vocabulary
- [ ] add much more vacobulary entries
- [ ] add topics in vocabulary file (colors, familly, work, ...)
